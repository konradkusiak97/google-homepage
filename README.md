This is my first attempt with HTML and CSS. It is the first project of the Odin Project's curriculum.

After few days I decided to spend more time on this project. I implemented several features from bootstramp and made the whole think look more like google original homepage.

The animals in the nav bar were supposed to redirect to a website about each animal. I didn't have time to implement it yet. For now I will leave it as it is.
